# fund-performance-analytics
This project is an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that automates the extraction, transformation, and loading of mutual fund NAV data into a Snowflake data warehouse, along with benchmark indices (NIFTY 50, BSE Sensex). The pipeline enables real-time comparison of mutual funds against their benchmarks, with full historical tracking.
